				<em>Jordan was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward and as a point guard. Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk and well-known work ethic.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<em>Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as "a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot." As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not "tough enough" to compete with him in practice.
			</p>
			<p>
				To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.			</p>
